I will help you husbands finish projects so you can surprise your wife. I will help all those that need help with finishing touches on their houses. I have been construction fo 20 plus years. I had a contracting company but couldn't continue with it because of health reasons but I am getting back into it and wanting to help everyone with their finishing projects. I have helped build houses before and helped build my own mothers house. I am wanting to get back into construction to do finishing work because I enjoy finishing up the house and making the house look better. I hope to hear from you soon and would like to help make your house look the way you want it to. </p>
